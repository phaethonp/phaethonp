# APIs for Property Development 
[WE-AI: APIs for property development](https://github.com/phaethonp/we-ai#api-for-property-development) WE-AI is the Siri for multiplayer communication on a Property Development platform. It is a virtual assistant that uses project data to interpret and respond to user requests. It's specifically designed to facilitate communication among users in the property development industry, by proactively identifying and surfacing relevant content and providing recommendations.<be><br>

### APIs AUTOMATE PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT
WE-AI aims to create a platform that automates property development. This platform identifies property development opportunities and displays relevant information about the respective development project. Upon subscription to our services, users gain access to all pertinent information about the project through a Question and Answer service, facilitated by an Artificial Intelligence Agent utilizing Natural Language Processing. Furthermore, users can program the AI Agent via Natural Language Processing to receive project-specific notifications.<br>

* Allows users to submit their own property development proposals for analysis.<br>
* The system analyzes these proposals and makes relevant information available.<br>
* Identifies property development opportunities tailored to user preferences.<br>
* Displays comprehensive information about each development project.<br>
* Provides a Question and Answer service powered by an AI Agent using Natural Language Processing.<br>
* Enables users to program the AI Agent to receive project-specific notifications.<br>

### WHY WE BUILD THIS FRAMEWORK<br>
We address these challenges:<br>
:small_blue_diamond: `Friction` `Lack of Data` `Uneven Information Distribution` `Safety` `Low Productivity` <br>
The **property development industry** is marked by **inherent challenges**, such as **friction** between parties due to **uneven information distribution, safety concerns**, issues related to **quality**, and **low productivity.**<br>
By connecting the myriad of stakeholders involved in property development processes via streamlined information sharing, we can mitigate these fragmented procedures. <br>

### HOW IT WORKS
:small_blue_diamond: Create the project Knowledge base<br>
**We unlock data reservoirs** that remain underutilized or even unused.
The property development industry is marked by inherent challenges, such as friction between parties due to uneven information distribution, safety concerns, issues related to quality, and low productivity. We address this with our Siri solution and project Knowledge base and possibly a few fine-tuned models.

:small_blue_diamond: APIs to Automate processes <br>
**We automate processes**, from design to construction, and from marketing to sales. Our versatile APIs serve as 'software glue,' bridging the gap between legacy systems and AI. This will enable us to operate as a fully automated property development company.

:small_blue_diamond: **Information retrieval and recommendation system** <br>
The system facilitates **direct communication through an AI assistant** among architects, contractors, and investors. This will enable direct investments in property development.
