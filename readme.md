# API for Property Development 
[WE-AI: APIs for property development](https://github.com/phaethonp/we-ai#api-for-property-development) WE-AI is the Siri for multiplayer communication on a Property Development platform. It is a virtual assistant that uses project data to interpret and respond to user requests. It's specifically designed to facilitate communication among users in the property development industry, by proactively identifying and surfacing relevant content and providing recommendations.<br>

### PROBLEM TO SOLVE
The **property development industry** is marked by **inherent challenges**, such as:`Friction` `Lack of Data`, `Uneven Information Distribution`, `Safety`, `Low Productivity`, `integrated Data Sources`, `Notifications` `Predictive Analytics`
WE-AI builds a knowledge base for every project that serves as  a source of truth for the retrieval of content available to all parties<br>

### EXPECTED SOLUTIONS
An integrated solution that proactively identifies and surfaces relevant content from the project's data pool and provides recommendations to all parties involved. <br>
The solution will enable us to connect the myriad parties involved in the property development markets via streamlined information sharing, and assembly fragmented procedures into a factory-like assembly line. Such a system would allow for the delivery of services to markets such as:
  
:small_blue_diamond: Property Management Services to homeowner markets
:small_blue_diamond: Contract Management Services to industry professional
:small_blue_diamond: A new type of Micro-City: Because our platform streamlines the development process, is making it possible to bring mid-scale projects to life in a fraction of the traditional timeframe 
:small_blue_diamond:Investment Attraction: The transparency and data-driven decision-making facilitated by the platform could make large-scale projects more attractive to investors, potentially leading to an increase in the supply of housing.
